# The Real Reason for House Price Inflation in New Zealand

Population growth, shortages in housing supply, internal migration, immigration, cheap money, and foreign investors are just a few of the causes of House Price Inflation (HPI) in New Zealand in recent years. The quintessential example of HPI in action is NZ's largest city - Auckland. The city has experienced double-digit HPI of late with a polarizing effect:
* Homeowner delight at increased "equity" 
* Increasing struggle for renters as disposable income shrinks

##Background
Before we dig into the numbers, some definitions are required:

__M3__: As per RBNZ [1]:
_The broadest monetary aggregate. Represents all New Zealand dollar funding of M3 institutions. Consists of notes & coin held by the public plus NZ dollar funding minus inter-M3 institutional claims and minus government deposits._

__Inflation__: This needs more than one definition as its a contentious concept. 

From Wikipedia [2]: _In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money â€“ a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy._

From Ludwig von Mises [3]: _In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur._

__Fractional Reserve Banking System__: 

From Investopedia [5]:
_A banking system in which only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash-on-hand and are available for withdrawal. This is done to expand the economy by freeing up capital that can be loaned out to other parties. Most countries operate under this type of system._

From Boundless [6]: _Because banks are only required to keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve and may loan out the rest, banks are able to create money. A lower reserve requirement allows banks to issue more loans and increase the money supply, while a higher reserve requirement does the opposite._
